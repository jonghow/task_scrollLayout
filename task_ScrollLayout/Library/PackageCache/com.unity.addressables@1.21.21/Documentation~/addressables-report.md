# Addressables Report

The Addressables Report is a tool that you can use to view information about the content built in an Addressables Build in depth.

To open the Addressables Report window, go to **Window** > **Asset Management** > **Addressables** and select **Addressables Report**.

## Prerequisites

* You must use Unity Editor version 2022.2 or newer. If you want to use the Addressables report, but your current Editor version is below 2022.2, you can use a [build report](BuildLayoutReport.md) built on an earlier version of the Unity Editor and import it into a project uses an Editor version newer than 2022.2, as long as the build report is built on a version of Addressables 1.21.8 or newer.
* The Addressables Report also requires a [build report](BuildLayoutReport.md) generated by an Addressables build to function. To enable the generation of build reports, go to **Edit > Preferences > Addressables** and enable **Debug Build Layout**.
* By default, the Addressables Report opens automatically after every build. To disable this, go to **Edit** > **Preferences** > **Addressables** and disable **Open Addressables Report After Build**.
